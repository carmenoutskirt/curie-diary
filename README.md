# curie-diary
the curie diary is top secret and only those who love polish cartoons and bartosz walaszek is allowed in.
intruders will be hass und liebe-d and fed into the radiation.
this will definitely be just a fun lil diary will all sorts of fandom stuff :-)
i will go through trial and error to add things to the repository.
glory to the fatherland!!!
long live poland
