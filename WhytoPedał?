wtf is up with eighan bro why to i keep hearing kdh songs from his phone and i peeked at it once and he was watching some guys react to a clip of it from his fyp like he actually wanted to watch it
and earlier i heard someone sing soda pop on his phone and he didnt even bother scrolling. should i confront him about it? i really dont want him to be a pedaÅ‚ for liking this typa shit.
go play gta bro dont listen to no kpop hunters >:(
