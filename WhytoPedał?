wtf is up with my lil bro why i keep hearing kdh songs from his phone
i peeked at it once and he was watching some guys react to it
like, he actually wanted to watch it
and earlier i heard someone sing soda pop on his phone and he didnt even bother scrolling.
should i confront him about it?
i really dont want him to be a pedaÅ‚
go play gta bro dont listen to no kpop hunters >:(
